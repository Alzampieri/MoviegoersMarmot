# Create a Basic App with React + TypeScript + Vite

Get data from [themovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and create a simple yet modern UI.

Feature :
- home page with 3 strate tv shows/movie/people
- 'category' pages for 'tv shows','movies' and 'people'
- language support for content (no trad on text itself yet.)
- detail page for 'tv shows' and 'movies' 

Placeholder (place made in UI): 
- profil management

Dropped for time shcedule : 
- support for translation (might add later)
- search bar in Home page (left of language select box)
- detail page for 'people'
- more information in 'details page' (need more api call to fetch theses data)
- responsive css
- breadcrumbs

Enjoy !
